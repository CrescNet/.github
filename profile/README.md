## :raising_hand: What is the Growth Network CrescNet?
The name "CrescNet" comes from the Latin word "crescere", which translates as "to grow and flourish". The name stands for the concern to assess children's growth competently and for the growing amount of data in order to be able to deal with several concerns successfully.

We would like to encourage paediatricians and adolescents to anonymously submit all data on the height, body weight and head circumference of their patients to a **central database**.

Permanently installed screening for growth and weight development disorders enables **systematic early detection of growth and weight development disorders**. CrescNet supports that children in need of control or treatment are co-managed by paediatric endocrinologists.

Beyond this early detection, CrescNet wants to use the growing data pool to **calculate reference values and trends**, provide valid **prerequisites for prevention programmes** and support the **search for test subjects for scientific studies**.
